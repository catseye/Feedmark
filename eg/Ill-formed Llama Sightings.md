### Definite llama sighting with no date

*   excuse: I don't remember what day it was

It was at least fifty feet tall but I don't remember what day it was.
I'm quite certain it was a llama, though.
It was just as if [2 Llamas Spotted Near Mall][].
It was just like [The Cutting Room Floor](https://tcrf.net/The_Cutting_Room_Floor)!
That's what it was like.
